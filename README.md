The biggest project i have worked on so far.

This is a functional streaming template. It has all the basic functionallity u would need for the simplest of streaming platforms and a decent base to start adding in and updating the code and design.

It is using:

Typescript, React, Redux, Redux Saga, Axios, React Router, Redux Form and Typesafe Actions. Also it has its own API server
